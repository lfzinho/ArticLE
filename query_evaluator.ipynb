       "  'abstract': \"  Diagnosing Brain Tumor with the aid of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has\\ngained enormous prominence over the years, primarily in the field of medical\\nscience. Detection and/or partitioning of brain tumors solely with the aid of\\nMR imaging is achieved at the cost of immense time and effort and demands a lot\\nof expertise from engaged personnel. This substantiates the necessity of\\nfabricating an autonomous model brain tumor diagnosis. Our work involves\\nimplementing a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for diagnosing brain\\ntumors from MR images. The dataset used in this paper consists of 253 brain MR\\nimages where 155 images are reported to have tumors. Our model can single out\\nthe MR images with tumors with an overall accuracy of 96%. The model\\noutperformed the existing conventional methods for the diagnosis of brain tumor\\nin the test dataset (Precision = 0.93, Sensitivity = 1.00, and F1-score =\\n0.97). Moreover, the proposed model's average precision-recall score is 0.93,\\nCohen's Kappa 0.91, and AUC 0.95. Therefore, the proposed model can help\\nclinical experts verify whether the patient has a brain tumor and,\\nconsequently, accelerate the treatment procedure.\\n\",\n",

Existing\\nsolutions typically require substantial cost to solve complex optimization\\nproblems, or class-balanced undersampling which can result in information loss.\\nIn this paper, we present the TRAS (TRAnsfer and Share) to effectively utilize\\nlong-tailed semi-supervised data. TRAS transforms the imbalanced pseudo-label\\ndistribution of a traditional SSL model via a delicate function to enhance the\\nsupervisory signals for minority classes. It then transfers the distribution to\\na target model such that the minority class will receive significant attention.\\nInterestingly, TRAS shows that more balanced pseudo-label distribution can\\nsubstantially benefit minority-class training, instead of seeking to generate\\naccurate pseudo-labels as in previous works. To simplify the approach, TRAS\\nmerges the training of the traditional SSL model and the target model into a\\nsingle procedure by sharing the feature extractor, where both classifiers help\\nimprove the representation learning. According to extensive experiments, TRAS\\ndelivers much higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods in the entire set\\nof classes as well as minority classes.\\n',\n",

Each network features a latent module which parametrizes the\\nmodel by a discrete grid topology vector for generalization (e.g., $n$ power\\nlines with $k$ disconnections or contingencies, if any), and the targeted\\nhigh-fidelity output is a weighted sum of linear and nonlinear functions. We\\ntested the model on 14- and 118-bus test cases and evaluated its performance\\nbased on the $n-k$ power flow prediction accuracy with respect to imbalanced\\ncontingency data and high-to-low-fidelity sample ratio.

       "  'abstract': '  Heart disease is one of the most common diseases causing morbidity and\\nmortality. Electrocardiogram (ECG) has been widely used for diagnosing heart\\ndiseases for its simplicity and non-invasive property. Automatic ECG analyzing\\ntechnologies are expected to reduce human working load and increase diagnostic\\nefficacy. However, there are still some challenges to be addressed for\\nachieving this goal. In this study, we develop an algorithm to identify\\nmultiple abnormalities from 12-lead ECG recordings. In the algorithm pipeline,\\nseveral preprocessing methods are firstly applied on the ECG data for\\ndenoising, augmentation and balancing recording numbers of variant classes. In\\nconsideration of efficiency and consistency of data length, the recordings are\\npadded or truncated into a medium length, where the padding/truncating time\\nwindows are selected randomly to sup-press overfitting. Then, the ECGs are used\\nto train deep neural network (DNN) models with a novel structure that combines\\na deep residual network with an attention mechanism. Finally, an ensemble model\\nis built based on these trained models to make predictions on the test data\\nset. Our method is evaluated based on the test set of the First China ECG\\nIntelligent Competition dataset by using the F1 metric that is regarded as the\\nharmonic mean between the precision and recall.

Most of the traditional image\\nSR obtains the LR sample by applying a fixed down-sampling operator. Real-SR\\nobtains the LR and HR image pair by incorporating different quality optical\\nsensors. Generally, Real-SR has more challenges as well as broader application\\nscenarios.
